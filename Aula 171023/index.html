    <p>Hello Kitty was created in 1974 and the first item, a vinyl coin purse, was introduced in 1975. Originally, Hello
        Kitty was only marketed towards pre-teenage girls, but beginning in the 1990s, the brand found commercial
        success among teenage and adult consumers as well. Hello Kitty's popularity also grew with the emergence of
        kawaii (cute) culture. The brand went into decline in Japan after the 1990s, but continued to grow in the
        international market.</p>
